This is for the course of Algorithm And Data Structure Analysis at Adelaide University in 2023
-> I think all code should get max points but it may not

-> Use code as a reference and never submit anything not authored by yourself as this will infringe the academic integrity policy

The assignments can be found from week 2 to week 6 (in ascending order)
